# Extrapolation-Barcode
Barcode extrapolation code with pyzbar as main source and Tesseract as second source used as double-check.

There are two modes: one with all pdf files, one for single pdf file with debug.

Notes:
If your pdf file isn't structured as the code needs to be, just comment the function which cut the first page to find the bar code.
The code is structured to recover also more data from the pdf file but it's an adding function, comment that part.

I'll try to clean this code for general purpose when I'll get time, sorry.
